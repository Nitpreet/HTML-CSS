# HTML-CSS
This was a minor project allocated to me in 3rd semester at GNDEC,LDH. 
The link to my designed website is http://nitpreettaneja.000webhostapp.com/
This was my first static website ever made .
The html code is given in index.html 
and CSS code is given in abc.css and xyz.css
and i have tried to use bootstrap too.
So this was my little commit.
